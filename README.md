# pymusic-player
A command line music player.

Just run main.py and a music will start The only thing this peice of software can do is pause, play adn rewind it. The way you can do that is available when you run the software ;-)

Note: I tested it on VSC(it works like a charm), Windows CommandLineInterface and PowerShell(On my pc these two places were the ui look like buggy)
